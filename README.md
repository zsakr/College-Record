# College Record
This project is to write a directory program that stores and processes entries for students, faculty and staff
members. My program will work with a user interface that will be in the DirectoryDemo class which supports
a number of operations. 

# The Directory class 

 Provides the main functionalities for your program. This class
uses an array to store Entry objects.
# The Entry class 
 Defines an object that all more specialized types of entries derive
from. This class serves as a base class for the the StudentEntry, StaffEntry and
FacultyEntry classes which add additional attributes and redefine behaviors for their
respective types.

My purpose is to write a directory program that stores and processes entries for students, faculty and staff
members. My program will work with a user interface that is provided to you and that supports
a number of operations typically available in a directory program. The interface and its operations
are depicted below.

The objectives for the project are to practice using arrays and inheritance to create a program
that supports a number of operations and leverages code reuse as well as to learn
