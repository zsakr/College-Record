# College Record
This project is to write a directory program that stores and processes entries for students, faculty and staff
members. My program will work with a user interface that will be in the DirectoryDemo class which supports
a number of operations. 

# The Directory class 

 Provides the main functionalities for your program. This class
uses an array to store Entry objects.
# The Entry class 
 Defines an object that all more specialized types of entries derive
from. This class serves as a base class for the the StudentEntry, StaffEntry and
FacultyEntry classes which add additional attributes and redefine behaviors for their
respective types.
